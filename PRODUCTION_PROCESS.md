# Production Process

The current publishing process for an episode.
We should automate more of this (well at least publishing).

## Editing

1. **First Pass:**

   - Hide video
   - Fix transcript
   - Fix Grammar
   - Fix timing issues
   - Make cuts

   **Timing style guide:**

   - If people take super long pauses shorten it to `.5-1s`
   - If a sentence starts with a filler word, super repeated word, or a false start I remove it
   - Remove mid sentence filler word if the audio still works

2. **Second Pass:**

   - Run at `2x` speed
   - Make sure the script is really right
   - Fix remaining grammar issues

3. **Third Pass:**

   - Run at `3x` speed
   - Make video cuts and switch between speakers

4. Add intro and outro
