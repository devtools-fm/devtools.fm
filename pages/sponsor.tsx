                We built DevTools.fm to connect with people who, like us, are
                passionate about building tools. Our current goal is to reduce
                the overhead of the podcast, continue to schedule high quality
                guests, broaden our audience, and expand the frequency of
                episodes. We're in this to make an impact, not a profit, but
                sustainability is key.
