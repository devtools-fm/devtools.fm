## Weekly Discoveries

- Our friends over at [PartyKit](https://partykit.io) [announced](https://twitter.com/partykit_io/status/1706630216318075119) their $2.5M raise. Congrats to Sunil and team! If you want to learn more about PartyKit, head over to [episode 49](https://www.devtools.fm/episode/49) to hear our interview with Sunil.
- We stumbled upon [DevHunt](https://devhunt.org), which is like product hunt but specifically for developer tools. If you're interested in discovering the latest tools or want a less saturated aggregator than product hunt to launch your dev tool, this might be just the ticket!
- [PostHog](https://posthog.com/) put out a [great article](https://posthog.com/blog/dev-marketing-paid-ads) last week on their experience marketing devtools to engineers. If you're trying to get word out about a tool you're building, this is definitely something to check out!
- [Deno](https://deno.com/) launched [queues](https://deno.com/blog/queues) functionality to go along side their existing KV storage. It's exciting to see them expand more into the services space with these clean APIs!
- We talk a lot about open source businesses on the podcast and Anh-Tho Chuong, CEO and co-founder of [Lago](https://www.getlago.com/), wrote an excellent post called [Open Source does not win by being cheaper](https://github.com/getlago/lago/wiki/Open-Source-does-not-win-by-being-cheaper). If you've created an open source tool you want to turn into a business or early in that journey we highly recommend giving it a read.
- Cloudflare launched [Workers AI](https://blog.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/) which allows you to run some popular AI models on the edge. It's great to see companies continuing to improve access and DX around AI models.
- Our friends over at Drifting in Space have a newsletter called the [BrowserTech Digest](https://digest.browsertech.com/) which is worth subscribing to. The last edition covered Andrew's [SyntaxFM interview](https://syntax.fm/show/655/supper-club-how-descript-built-a-next-gen-video-editor-in-the-browser-with-andrew-lisowski) which is also worth checking out.

That's all the highlights for this week! If you'd like us to include something for next week feel free to drop us a line at host@devtools.fm.

## This Week's Episode

In this week's episode we talk to [Eric Elliot](https://ericelliottjs.com/) about [SudoLang](https://github.com/paralleldrive/sudolang-llm-support), a programming language designed specifically for interacting with large language models.

SudoLang is unique in that it uses a minimal set of conventions that LLMs typically pick up on without having to preface context of how you'd like the code to be interpreted. We recommend checking out Eric's [AI Programming for Absolute Beginners](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/ai-programming-for-absolute-beginners-16ac3fc6dea6) for an intro to how SudoLang works. It'd be fairly easy to write a tamagotchi in sudolang!
